### Get transcripts from YouTube


I use this as a research tool mainly for channels like [Moe Factz with Adam Curry](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC00YFNgWmjrh1gNBi2tmdmA) for 
my US/Black History learning and [Jack Spirko's survival podcast](https://www.youtube.com/user/survivalpodcasting) for permaculture and 
things of that nature.

All transcripts are indexed by my app of choice, they're searchable, and can be hyper-
linked for studying purposes. 



You will need to get the vtt2txt python file first and save it in a directory that will
host the transcript files you'd like to download. 

from there open a terminal in the same folder as the vtt2txt file.

then run the command 

```chmod +x copyandpaste.sh```

first and then run the command

``` ./copyandpaste.sh```


then be sure to use ctrl, shift, and v to paste in the youtube channel, playlist, or video
url.

you can use any markdown tool to view all transcripts that have been downloaded.
I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) because you can sync everything across devices plus theres a lot of community
plugins that are useful. 

happy searching!
